Term/idea,Definition
Accessioning,"This term is used broadly to describe adding new items to a collection. It is most commonly been used in archives and museum terminology, particularly for assigning ""accession numbers"" to denote when/from where an item was obtained. Digital accessioning can include the concept of a ""re-accession,"" for when digital items have been updated or corrected in some way and need to be processed again.
"
API,"Application Programming Interface. Broadly defined, an API is how different software applications can ""talk"" to each other and share information. In library practice, this usually takes the format of a JSON file URL that can be accessed by a script for harvesting data, metadata, or schema information.

Bounding box,"A bounding box delineates the geographic extent of a given spatial dataset, and is typically concieved as the smallest hypothetical rectangle that would fully enclose the features of a spatial dataset. It is defined by four coordinates: the hypothetical rectangle's minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, and maximum latitude. These coordinates correspond, respectively, with the hypothetical rectangle's leftmost line, its bottom, its rightmost line, and its top. A dataset's bounding box is an important component of geospatial metadata. Note that it is often also referred to as an ""envelope"".

Groundhog Day references (and why we have them),"Geo4Lib Camp has always been held just before or just after February 2, Groundhog Day. During one conference, a plan for a speaker fell through at the last minute, and the Geo4Lib Camp organizers asked several attendees, including Andrew Battista, to give an impromptu talk. Andrew has a long personal tradition of writing essays that apply some academic discipline or critical method to the film Groundhog Day (1993). Andrew gave a talk on a Spatial Humanities reading of the film, and while strange, the talk was well-received. It has become somewhat of a tradition for Andrew to give a short talk each year about Groundhog Day. See the 2020 talk at http://tiny.cc/groundhog2020/

"Software basics (GitHub, pull request, versions, open source)","A software application is considered open source if its source code is freely available to users, who can expand, adapt, modify, and distribute this code as they see fit. Open source software is typically developed collaboratively; as a result, it is important to be able to systematically track changes to the codebase, and to track different versions of a project that result from these changes. Git is a version control system that facilitates collaboration on open-source projects (such as the Geoblacklight project) by allowing participants to essentially ""track changes"" and follow each others' work. Github is a web platform that allows users to collaborate on open-source projects using the Git version control system. In the context of Github, a pull request is a procedure wherein someone who wishes to make changes to a project's codebase requests a member of the project team to review these proposed changes; if the reviewer approves these changes, they become incorporated (or ""merged"") into the main codebase.

"Spatial data infrastructure components (Geoblacklight, geoserver, repository, etc.)","A spatial data infrastructure is a digital apparatus (comprised of interconnected applications and repositories) that facilitates geospatial data storage, discovery, and long-term preservation. Geoblacklight is an application that allows users to discover geospatial data, access relevant metadata, preview layers, and download GIS datasets. Geoserver is an open-source server that allows for GIS data sharing; more specifically, in the context of the Geoblacklight application, it facilitates layer previews and downloads. Institutions that use Geoblacklight as a spatial data discovery platform typically also preserve these underlying datasets in the context of an institutional repository, as well as share relevant metadata through OpenGeoMetadata (a metadata repository that allows institutions to index geospatial data owned by other institutions, and hence data discoverable on their local Geoblacklight instances). There are many moving parts in a spatial data infrastructure; for a more detailed explication of these parts and how they fit together, see the narrative description authored by NYU Data Services.

Sprints,"Sprints refer to an intensive period of time (usually 1-2 weeks) set aside to make significant progress on something. This is a popular concept in many software development practices, such as Scrum. The GeoBlacklight community holds sprints two times per year, and many institutions hold local sprints for their own applications. Although sprints are often thought of as for coding and development, the GeoBlacklight community follows a model in which sprints can address any type of issue, from documentation to metadata to governance and more.
